ISSUES to be fix

PERFORMANCE OPTIMAZTION :

-- ngOnInit(): void {
    this.selectedColor = this.config[0].color;
    this.showPattern = this.config[0].pattern ?? false;
    this.barSize = this.config[0].barThickness ?? 30;
    this.buildChart();
  }   

HERE THE PROBLEM IS WE ARE RE UPDATING OUR WHOLE CHARTS FOR EVERY TIME USER DID SOMETHING 
IT WILL RE LOADING AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR SIMPLE CHANGES. 
 

BAR SIZE ISSUE-

Here the issue is when the use increase the bar thicknes, it is mergin with other bars, tried ro fix it with two getters to get dynamic 
width and height. its working but its mainly working on graph not on the bar, have to fix it mainly bar.

COLOR BAR ISSUE 

i have created a color and color also chaning but the issue we dont have any okey or save button for color, 
also when i refresh the page it changing to the default color, 

TO fix
we have to store the user pref color into the localstorage.
